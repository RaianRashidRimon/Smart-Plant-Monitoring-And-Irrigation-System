# 🌱 Smart Plant Monitoring & Irrigation System 

## 📌 Overview
The _**Smart Plant Monitoring & Irrigation System**_ is an IoT-enabled automation project designed to intelligently manage irrigation while providing real-time monitoring of plant conditions. By leveraging internet connectivity, this system allows users to remotely track soil moisture levels and ensure plants receive the right amount of water, reducing both overwatering and underwatering.

Built with a NodeMCU (ESP8266) microcontroller, soil moisture sensors and a relay-controlled water pump, the system automates irrigation by activating the pump only when moisture levels fall below a predefined threshold with also manual control. Additionally, the IoT integration enables data logging and remote access, making plant care more efficient, sustainable and user-friendly.
